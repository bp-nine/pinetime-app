# README for pinetime-app

This is an app for the pinetime smart watch from [the pine64 website](https://www.pine64.org/pinetime/).

The pinetime smart watch works much like an Arduino, in that it can only run one program/image at a time.  It does not run linux, so you cannot load multiple applications up dynamically.  As I understand it, all the functionality has to be in one application.

You are free to use this code if it helps you, but I offer it with no warrantee or suitablility for a specific purpose; if this bricks your pinetime, don't blame me. :-)

## Initial aim

The initial aim is to get a simple watchface and clock to run on it:

After that, I want to:

1. enable the step counter
2. enable the heart rate monitor

## First steps

Please see [the project notes](docs/project_notes.md) for details.
